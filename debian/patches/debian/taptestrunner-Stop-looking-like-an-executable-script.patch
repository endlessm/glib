Subject: taptestrunner: Stop looking like an executable script

This file is installed as non-executable but starts with the #! that
indicates an executable script, causing warnings from Debian's Lintian
tool. In fact it is imported as a Python module rather than being run
as an executable, so there is no need for the #! line.
