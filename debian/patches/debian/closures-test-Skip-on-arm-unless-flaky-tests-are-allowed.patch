Subject: closures test: Skip on arm* unless flaky tests are allowed

Choosing the right number of iterations to avoid either taking literally
hours on some hardware, or getting spurious failures when one thread
starves another, seems to be too hard to get right in practice.
Make this test opt-in so that its failures aren't release-critical.
We can run it as a separate autopkgtest that is marked flaky.
