glib2.0 (2.46.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add debian/patches/disable-failing-test-for-pcre838.patch
    - disable regexp test that fails with new system pcre 8.38
      which just hit Debian unstable. Needs further investigation
      but lets not leave the build broken during the holidays.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Fix typo in previous changelog entry.

  [ Andreas Henriksson ]
  * Add debian/patches/bug712848-volume-monitor-deadlock-kfreebsd.patch
    - patch by and big thanks to Steven Chamberlain for debugging this!
    - given lack of feedback from upstream, which would be very welcome
      for deep changes like this, use an ifdef to only change on
      *FreeBSD for now... (Closes: #712848)
  * Add --no-ddebs arg to dh_strip for refdbg package build which
    otherwise fails and I doubt we need ddeb/dbgsym for our debug
    package.

glib2.0 (2.46.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop clean-la.mk from debian/rules, no longer required.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * New upstream release 2.46.1
    + Remove system_header pragma (should fix lack of warnings with things
      like g_return_if_fail)
    + move GStrv typedef (and auto-cleanup) from libgobject to libglib
    + fix order of trashing files to be closer to what is required in the
      specification. Namely, trashinfo files are written first.  This should
      fix issues with the gvfs trash backend failing to correctly read the
      info for recently trashed files (preventing 'restore'). (Closes:
      #800491) (LP: #1495943)
    + tweak mime logic to return text/plain on all empty files instead of
      returning application/octet-stream.  This includes files that have
      extensions that imply that they may be other types of files, which is a
      slight change of behaviour with respect to old GLib versions. (LP:
      #1497170)
  * debian/patches/0001-Revert-list-store-Fix-a-parameter-check.patch: Drop -
    this is applied upstream in this release.

glib2.0 (2.45.1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release 2.45.1
    + The GSettings schema compiler, glib-compile-schemas has been changed
      to reject schema xml that has duplicate <summary> or <description>
      elements. Such elements typically occur when translations are merged
      into the schema, with xml:lang attributes. This is not the correct way
      to translate schemas. Instead keep the translations in the .mo file and
      set the gettext-domain attribute on the <schemalist> element. To avoid
      breaking already-installed schemas, this change is only taking effect
      when you use the --strict option.
    + The file monitoring infrastructure has been rewritten, and all backends
      have seen major improvements.
      + The inotify backend is reporting events with less delay (no event will
        be delayed more than 10ms) and wakeups due to file monitoring have
        been significantly reduced. A CHANGES_DONE event will also be sent
        when new files appear.
      + The poll implementation is now using the thread default main context.
      + The fam implmentation is now running in the worker thread.
      + The fen implementation has been removed, since it was unmaintained.
    + The hardcoded 10-thread limit of GTask's thread pool has been removed,
      since it was prone to causing deadlocks. The thread pool is now allowed
      to grow dynamically and will shrink back over time.
    + GSimpleAsyncResult has been deprecated in favor of GTask.
    + The algorithm used by GAppInfo to find default handlers for mime types
      has been tweaked to prefer apps that handle the specific subtype over
      default handlers for a generic supertype.
  * d/p/regex-test-do-not-assert-that-system-PCRE-allows-P-1.patch: Drop,

    - The Unicode support has been updated to version 7.0 of the Unicode

    - GMutex now uses a faster, native implementation on Linux
  * 0001-gvariant-tests-workaround-libc-compiler-issue.patch: Drop, applied
    upstream in this release.
  * Add new symbols for this release.
  * Merge in changes from 2.40.0-4
    + Adapt for system pcre3/1:8.35 (Closes: #755439):
      - a PCRE 8.31 bug in case-insensitivity has been fixed, so do not assert
        bug-for-bug compatibility with 8.31
      - named match groups' names cannot start with a digit any more, so
        (?P<1>.) is no longer allowed; do not assert that it is
      - turn off a new optimization that would reduce the result set when
        called from g_match_all(_full), to preserve existing functionality
    + Build-depend on pcre3/1:8.35 so that the new optimization is
      known to be turned off in the built binaries
    + Add patch from upstream to fix mis-optimization in gvariant test
      with gcc 4.9 (Closes: #756272)
    + Avoid using dbus-launch for regression tests (Closes: #737488):
      - run installed-tests under dbus-run-session from dbus (>= 1.8)
      - do not run build-time tests under dbus-launch: those that use D-Bus
        all create their own session bus instances now
        (i.e. remove 05_run-gio-tests-with-a-dbus-session.patch)
      - set a deliberately invalid DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS to make sure
        nothing in the build is still inheriting it from the environment
    + Override Lintian false positive #733733: we build-depend on python:any
      but Lintian doesn't yet understand :any syntax
  * Make the installed tests still run dbus-launch if we don't have
    dbus-run-session (i.e. if the installed dbus is << 1.8).

    - Increased use of (nullable) attribute on out values and return types now
      that it is supported (mostly from porting Vala metadata).
    - use XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP for OnlyShowIn/NotShowIn handling of desktop
      files, deprecating g_desktop_app_info_set_desktop_env()
    - add support for g_desktop_app_info_get_implementations() to find desktop
      files that have an Implements= line for a given interface
    - GHmac has gained SHA-512 support
    - support the new mimeapps specification (most notably, moving the
      assoications/defaults configuration to ~/.config/mimeapps.list).
    - libgobject is now linked -Wl,-z,nodelete when possible to avoid errors
      when gobject is used from a module for a program that does not itself use
      gobject and that module is unloaded/reloaded

glib2.0 (2.35.9-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * d/p/11_kfreebsd_pthread_condattr_setclock_prototype.patch:
    + Another patch to fix the build on kfreebsd. Add a prototype
      for pthread_condattr_setclock() when building on kfreebsd
      since the prototype there is missing. The glibc bug to add
      the missing prototype is #703545, we can remove this hack
      when that is fixed.
  * debian/patches/13_sparc_prlimit_prototype.patch:
    + New patch, only use prlimit if the prototype is available.
      Should fix the build on sparc where prlimit is available but
      the prototype is missing. Thanks to Julien Cristau for the
      patch. This works-around #703559 and can be removed when that
      bug is fixed.
  * debian/patches/15_gio_desktop_app_info_test_bin_true_path.patch:
    + Change path for 'true' to /bin/true as that's where it is in
      Debian. This fixes a testcase that was failing on every arch
      and was causing the build to fail on ia64 and powerpc as test
      failures are fatal on those arches.
  * debian/rules:
    + Use filter instead of findstring to match the current arch
      against the list of architectures where the test suite should
      not be fatal, as the latter matches substrings and so it was
      making the testsuite non-fatal on amd64 and i386 because they
      match kfreebsd-amd64 and kfreebsd-i386.

    + debian/patches/04_homedir_env.patch:
      - Updated to apply again.
  * debian/rules:
    + Set HOME instead G_HOME, as GLib now honors the former. We will
      eventually remove our local patch to support G_HOME, so packages
      that need to override the home directory for the test suite should
      switch to overriding HOME.
  * debian/libglib2.0-0.symbols:
    + Bump minimum version for g_get_home_dir() so that users that need
      HOME to be honored get a proper runtime dependency.
  * debian/patches/10_kfreebsd_issetugid_prototype.patch:
    + Untested patch to fix the build on kfreebsd.

  * Configure cross builds with --disable-modular-tests --disable-gtk-doc.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Merges from unstable branch (Michael Biebl)
    - Take into account multiarch when removing the cache files in postrm:
      Remove /usr/lib/gio/modules/giomodule.cache only for the native
      architecture for which this cache file was created.
      After removing /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/gschemas.compiled on purge,
      run dpkg-trigger explicitly, so in case libglib2.0-0 is installed for
      other architectures, the cache file is re-created. (Closes: #696389)
    - Drop the various Breaks from libglib2.0-0. Those are causing APT to
      fail on a dist-upgrade from squeeze to wheezy. (Closes: #676485)
  * Refresh patches and slightly rework debian/patches/04_homedir_env.patch:
    g_get_home_dir() now respects the HOME environment variable but we'll keep
    G_HOME for now as packages in Debian rely on it.
  * gdbus-codegen .py files have moved to /usr/share/glib-2.0 
  * Update symbols file 

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release 2.35.4
  * debian/libglib2.0-0.symbols: Update for new upstream release.
  * Drop 08_disable_gapplication_basic_test.patch, test is now more robust.
  * Drop 92_revert_appinfo_command_line.patch and add xterm build dependency;
    xterm is rather lightweight in terms of dependencies and is sufficient to
    run all the "Terminal=true" tests.
  * Add 08_fix_closure_invalidation.patch: gsignal: fix closure invalidation
    code. (GNOME #690118)

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]

  * Add 07_disable_tests_on_slow_archs.patch: Disable tests on slow
    architectures which keep failing the tests. These are currently
    /socket/timed_wait, /mainloop/timeouts, /mainloop/child_sources,
    /timeout/rounding, and the upper bound on /gdbus/method-calls-in-thread on

  * debian/control.in: Bump pcre dependency to >= 1:8.31.
  * debian/rules: Seems there is no way of making the test suite work reliably
    with the upgraded Ubuntu ARM builders, so make tests non-fatal on
    arm{el,hf} until they get less swap happy.

  [ Iain Lane ]
  * Add revert_g_file_make_directory_with_parents_error_propagation.patch:

glib2.0 (2.19.8-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/patches/01_gettext-desktopfiles.patch,
    debian/patches/02_gettext-desktopfiles-ubuntu.patch:
    + Updated from the Ubuntu package, thanks to Martin Pitt for the changes:
      - 01_gettext-desktopfiles.patch: Merge OpenSUSE's and our patch:
        - Now prefers inline translations over gettext translations, which
          fixes a few corner cases (like renaming .desktop files on the
          user's desktop), is more in line with the recent gconf patch,
          and more palatable for upstream inclusion.
        - Use X-GNOME-Gettext-Domain, for preparing upstream inclusion.
        - Forwarded upstream now.
      - Add 02_gettext-desktopfiles-ubuntu.patch: Provide backwards
        compatibility for 01_gettext-desktopfiles.patch for
        X-{Debian,Ubuntu}-Gettext-Domain. The latter was changed to use
        X-GNOME-, so this is necessary until all our .desktop files are
        converted.
